            Hello, my name is Jancarlo Sevilla, and I am a recent graduate.
            I studied in Programming mainly works in Java, C++, and a bit of Python.
            After I graduated, I went travelling with my friends and family.
            I visited my cousins who I never heard of as well as my friend’s family along the way.
            I love reading books and listening to music as I get easily immersed.
            This also includes my last alternative which is video games whenever I can’t find a good book to read.
            I joined Revature in hopes to find individual growth as well as improve both my soft skills and technical
            skills.
        </p>
